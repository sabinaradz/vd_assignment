      the gif I chose to create is a subtle sparkle on a plain version of my
      logo. I chose to keep this simple in order to prevent any degradation in
      quality when using a small file size. Due to the minimalistic appearance,
      there are a number of applications for this gif. One of these would be in
      a 'story' or video content type post, as a cover image or intro for
      further content. This would also be effective as a standalone promotional
      post.
