      The below images include photos I have taken and edited in Photoshop (the
      left pictures are originals, and the pictures on the right are post
      editing), and also logos/icons I created in Illustrator. I saved the
      photographs as .jpg and the graphics/line drawings as .png as these best
      represent the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/jpeg-vs-png/"">format in which the images were created.</a>

    <p>This is the logo I used for my project. It is an adaptation of an existing logo I created and use for my personal business, with the bottom word swapped from 'nails' to 'press'. This logo was created in Illustrator. To be able to use this logo in my web project, alongside a colourful  I ensured to save the file with transparency, in order to prevent a disruption of natural flow by having a square background around a circular logo.</p>

      For this image, I blurred the background to emphasise the foreground,
      reduced the saturation and adjusted the colour balance to neutralise the
      overly warm tones, to avoid clashind with other images. I also edited out
      some blemishes and uneven tone on the skin. I chose this image due to the
      good resolution and good lighting, therefore making editing a much more
      enjoyable task.

    <p>
      I had wanted to include this image in my web project as it is a good
      example of the work that i do. However, this was a client picture and did
      not have a neutral background which I prefer to maintain uniformity amongst the other images. I edited a white silk
      background to match the other image of nails against a fabric background,
      and lightened the edges of the fingers to emulate a light source from top
      right as opposed to from above.

      <p>
        Taking pictures of 'products' proved the most difficult as the lighting
        conditions were not ideal and the camera used could not capture the
        vibrancy and sharpness of the objects. Therefore in my editing, I
        increased the saturation and contrast while also cropping the image to
        better focus on the subject. I wasn't overall satisfied with the results of this as I was unable to outline the object well to edit the background separately, due to the similar colours. I would consider a differently coloured backdrop to then be able to edit easily using Photoshop.

      </div>
<p>For this image, I brightened the background to match the other content. I also fixed some blemishes and slight discolouration using the spot healing tool. I ended up not using this image in my web project, as the picture is in a slightly different hand position which doesn't match the theme for the rest of my images.</p>

        />
      </div>
      <p>I created a shopping cart icon to use within my mockups, based on a black icon I found. Despite looking for a transparent image in an svg file (good for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp">manipulating and resizing</a> in Illustrator due to it being a vector based graphic instead of pixel), the lines were not as clean as I had hoped when resizing. Therefore I copied the existing icon, but used white lines. This also came with the advantage of being able to manipulate the icon line by line, which helped match its proportions to the visuals of the mock ups.
