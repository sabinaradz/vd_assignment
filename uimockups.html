    <h1>UI Mockups</h1>

    <p>
      These are the mockups I created for my web project. I utilised the grid
      method by <a href="https://960.gs/">960.gs</a> to be able to create a
      visually pleasing, proportionate and neat layout.

    <div>
      <h3>Homepage</h3>

        alt="landing page of a website with white background and 3 green block elements"
        height="400px"
      />
      <p>
        For this website, I chose to utilise a simplified navigation bar with a
        universally recognised 'hamburger' icon representing the menu. the
        presence of simple but informative icons to replace text allows for
        greater accessibility when interacting with users from different regions, and the absence of words makes the bar appear more streamlined.
        of the world. I chose to include a search bar on the navigation bar so that it is simple for the user to find what they are looking for.
        The footer includes information that isn't necessarily what a user looks for when shopping but that is important to include. As is standard I have included these at the bottom of the page where most modern websites store these links.

      <h3>Menu Extended</h3>

        alt="website navigation menu"
        height="400px"
      />
      <p>
        I chose to create a mockup of the 'hambuger' menu extended to see how it
        would complement the layout of the website. I chose to maintain the flow
        of the banner by keeping the background colour the same and centering
        the elements to make theme easy to see instantly upon opening the menu.

      <h3>Product Page</h3>

      height="400px">
      <p>For the product page, I chose a typical layout of 4 images per row and included filter/sort options for the user to be able to narrow down the selection of products and made both of these highly visible at the top. In future iterations, I could also add an option to show less or more tiles per row for users that need easier visibility of each item.</p>

    <h3>Help Page</h3>

    <p>The final mockup I have created is for a help page, that has an embedded YouTube tutorial video. In keeping with the minimalistic theme of the website, I chose to use a visual aid instead of a large amount of text. </p>
